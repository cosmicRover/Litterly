## Cleaning up the world, one piece of trash at a time

The MVVM re-write will allow the app to be more reactive, performant and easier to expand. Along with the new architecture, the underlying data structures will be replaced with more performant ones. MVVM is great for test driven development and thus, I will implement unit tests as well!
